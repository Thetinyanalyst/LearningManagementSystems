# Introduction

A learning management system is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, materials or learning and development programs.

The NWIS learning management system allows for a smooth transition of data from the classroom to the parent and student portal. This allows for studentâ€™s to take ownership of their educational journey while allow allowing the parents to be an equivalent part of it.

The staff and admin periodically update the LMS with the day to day tasks and activities of the students, both academic and recreational. The LMS also allows for the parents to be able to view (if any) disciplinary infractions as well as the current learning goals of the students. 

Student rubrics are updated periodically showcasing their participation and levels of understanding in a subject. Weekly plans and daily work along with student assignments can also be found here.
